<h1>Send a Smoke Signal</h1>
<p class="subheading">Like any other normal person, nothing would please me more than giving a stranger the ability to contact you at any given time. So if you resonate with any of my passions or have any thoughts about my content, feel free to reach out using any of the below :)</p>
<p class="subheading">And leave your contact info if you're using the form and would like a reply, because none of the VCs in the city have agreed to fund my telepathy machine (yet)</p>
