<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome</h1>

<p>Welcome to my low-traffic corner of the internet. You may scroll around and see if you find anything interesting. You may also scroll around to convince yourself that you are being productive by learning something new on the internet (you aren't).</p>
<p>This space is for photos I'm fond of, things I think about, and anyting my brain would like to shelve (but not lose) - like that perenially open browser tab that I'll definitely get to someday. I've split this site into sections for photography and blogging. Don't expect too much, it's more of an online filing cabinet for me while I postpone having to upgrade to a 2TB Google One plan.
<p>That's pretty much it â€“ no newsletter or cookies or anything. If you've got any thoughts or would like to reach out, you can always hmu <span style="color: #49bf9d; text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;">here</span>. (jk I'm too lazy to code a hyperlink so you can just go to the Contact page yourself)</p>
