<h1 style="text-align: center;">Congratulations! Here's your existential crisis</h1>

<p>You're finally back from that trip you'd been counting down to for months. Days spent overplanning every single attraction, restaurant, and activity. Now you're home again, suitcase thrown in a corner of your room (pile of laundry in the other corner). You make space for your latest fridge magnet amongst his new neighbors, and take a step back to admire your Picasso of tourist traps. Oddly anticlimactic. You suddenly think, "Huh. Now what?"</p>

<div style="margin: 2em 0;">
  <strong>Arrival Fallacy</strong><br />
  <span style="font-style: italic; color: #666;">
    The subtle melancholy or emptiness experienced upon finally achieving a long-held goal, initially believed to ensure long-term happiness.

<p>It's what keeps us upgrading perfectly fine phones or buying those shoes you don't really need. We often know it's coming, yet we don't try anything to stop it — we binge-watch our shows, desperately trying to get to the end, knowing the void that's waiting once we're done.</p>

<p>You're probably already familiar with this comic on success:</p>

<p>Here's my take on how it usually ends:</p>

<p>It's something that's built into us humans, the tendency to set our newfound happiness as a baseline for our future — but it's not always a bad thing. It helps us set bigger goals, to dream bigger dreams. Otherwise who knows, we might've still been using carrier pigeons to slide into DMs or receiving the latest episode of <i>Mindhunter</i> (RIP) as a DVD in our mailboxes.</p>

<p><i>Imo</i>, the trick to escaping this is never setting some sort of grand <i>pièce de résistance</i> in what you're doing, never actually having to "arrive" at some ultimate goal, and instead realizing the joy in a random Tuesday at work, or a Sunday afternoon nap that hits like skipping leg day.</p>

<p>Since I started this by talking about a trip, allow me to end it the same way. Here's something I found on IG that I liked and felt appropriate to the situation:</p>
