<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Strange Comfort in Quiet Profiling</h1>

<!-- start -->

<p>A funny thing in people's behavior these days ‚Äì most of them are much more comfortable with the lack of privacy when those accessing their info are not known to them.</p>

<p>And what do I mean by this?</p>

<p>To explain, let me talk about the two ways I like to think of ‚Äòprivacy‚Äô:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Algorithmic privacy </strong><br />
  This is the privacy that we‚Äôre trained to care about. Your data scraped and sold by millions of corporations every second you use your phone.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Social privacy </strong><br />
  The privacy we guard from friends, neighbors, relatives. The one you try to keep out of gossip and judgement. This is less about data and more about perception, less about what's collected and more about who sees it.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So let‚Äôs go back to my earlier line ‚Äì when I said that people are more comfortable with the lack of privacy when strangers are involved, I meant that people are more comfortable with a lack of algorithmic privacy, rather than the lack of social privacy.</p>

<p>Now, if you‚Äôre thinking <i>‚ÄòNo way, I definitely care about my privacy‚Äô</i> - take a second and think back. You probably remember declining browser cookies on some website. Or perhaps, you enabled a ‚Äúdo not track‚Äù request when you were offered the option (üòé). You always choose privacy when <em>offered an option</em>. But ask yourself ‚Äì if this option were to disappear overnight, how many of you would <em>really</em> be bothered by it?<br />
On the other hand, if someone who knows you well found out how long you spent on a particular website, or how long you hovered over a post before scrolling, that would probably bother you a lot more than you‚Äôd admit.</p>

<p>People are surprisingly okay being treated as a data point, as long as the data isn‚Äôt being monitored by someone they know. Algorithms don‚Äôt gossip or judge. They don‚Äôt publicly prey on your vulnerabilities. Ironically, this is also what makes them so powerful ‚Äì they influence your likes, purchases, and ideologies without you ever realizing. They don‚Äôt read your mind or record your voice, they are just reading your personal diary that you hand-wrapped and gave them.</p>

<p>So, are we evolving into a society where lifeless algorithms written by strangers know you more than those around you?</p>

<p>Just remember, it‚Äôs okay if the algorithm knows you‚Äôve got Hollaback Girl on repeat, but God forbid your friends find out.</p>
